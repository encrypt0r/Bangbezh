# Bangbezh
This project is a continuation of [Bangbezh.com](http://bangbezh.com), it's meant to be a cross-platform [adhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan) app for Desktop, Web and Mobile. Currently it's at the very early stages, and it might progress very slowly since it's a side project and I don't plan to work on it very frequently.

This project will solve some of the old bangbezh's limitations:
 - World-wide coverage
 - Cross-platform
 - Multiple sources for prayer times: Manual and Calculated (Maybe some web services as well)
 - Multilingual
 - Provide an API for 3rd party usage
